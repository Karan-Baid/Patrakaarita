OPPOSING VIEWPOINT (BONUS)
============================================================
From a US perspective, the article could be seen as biased towards Colombia, as it portrays Petro's statements as a dare to Trump without providing adequate context about the reasons behind the US military operation in Venezuela. A more balanced view might argue that the US has legitimate concerns about the situation in Venezuela and that Petro's statements are inflammatory and unhelpful in resolving the crisis.
